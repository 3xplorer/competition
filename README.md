This is my first Project pushed on github.
It deals with hammiltonian paths. 

Definition of a hammiltonian path:
A Hamiltonian path or traceable path is a path that visits each vertex exactly once. A graph that contains a Hamiltonian path is called a traceable graph. A graph is Hamiltonian-connected if for every pair of vertices there is a Hamiltonian path between the two vertices.
